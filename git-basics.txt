Hello World

Git is use for 
1 History Management
2 SCM so you can work in team
3 It initialize the folder with .git folder so it can track history
4 github is the code hosting place where you can store your code
5 .git folder is the one who track the history which provides by git when dp git init
6 remember commit means history in the project

Steps:

1 git status to check if the folder is initiated
2 if not than git init
3 make some changes into folder
4 git add . (all files) or git add filename
5 git commit -m "any masgs" and it will add to master branch
6 git restore --staged filename it will unstage the changes of the file or all
7 git log to check the history of code base
8 git reset hashId. but it will do all the reset above it remember
9 git coonfig user.name or user.email or --get-all user.name or --get-all user.email

How to delete and revert changes
once you stage something and commit it. if you want to revert this commit

you need the command git reset id

then you will get the things unstage

for getting the file back you need to do git checkout filename
and if you want to content back you need to stash it first then pop or clear it

and if you want to unstage something you can do 

git restore --staged filename or git restore --stages .

you can also restore your working directoy

by using git checkout --.
but for that you need to git reset HEAD or git reset id od it i will go to unstage

Stashing (for backend of staging)
1 git stash
2 git stash pop (resolve if confliciting)
3 git stash clear


GitHub:

Now you want to connect you local folder to the some code hosting

you need to copythe link from the code hosting and use command

git remote(iss ka matlab urls) add origin(it is for url yani tum kaya name rakh rahay hoo yahan url to jo tum add karnay lagay hoo aur wo url will e connected to .git in local folder) https://github.com/fazi1live/Learning-Git.git

by convention origin is the name for your personal account and code cloud hosting  are in origin or you can have other name

once you connect the url
you need to check it by using git remote -v

now you need to add your chaned to the code hosting so for that


What is head?
Answer: Head is the place where you all commits are addind and it is the pointer
which is pointin to a branch. which means that you code is going into head and eventually
to this particular branch

====== git checkout
git checkout means head to point to new branch or to get deleted file back


===== git branch
it will check all the branches

===== note for every branch there will be a only one Pull request and every updated will go to that pull request branch
but if you merge one Pull request and you made changes to that branch it will say you main is behind and then you need to create another pull request

so jaab pull request merge kar loo tu hemeshae new branch banaoo ussi branch main na push karo
pull request k bad wo cheeze khatam


==== git rebase:  git rebase --i hasid will help you to merge commits using squash and pick
